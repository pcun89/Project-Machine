# Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplantation Survival Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to build a classification pipeline to predict the survival status of pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. The dataset used for this project is sourced from UCIâ€™s Machine Learning Repository and contains various characteristics related to the transplantation process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pediatric-bmt-survival-prediction.git
cd pediatric-bmt-survival-prediction
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Tasks

1. **Investigate the Data:**
   - Explore the dataset containing bone marrow transplantation characteristics.
   - Identify relevant input and output features.

2. **Prepare Data:**
   - Separate target variable (`survival_status`) and features.
   - Categorize columns as numerical or categorical based on unique values.

3. **Handle Missing Values:**
   - Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.

4. **Split the Data:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

5. **Create Preprocessing Pipeline:**
   - Implement preprocessing pipelines for numerical and categorical features.
   - Use techniques such as imputation and one-hot encoding.

6. **Create Classification Pipeline:**
   - Build a classification pipeline including preprocessing, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and a logistic regression classifier.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Explore hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Optimize the number of PCA dimensions for each classifier.

8. **Evaluate Model:**
   - Assess the performance of the final model on the test set.
   - Compare results with the initial model.

## Project Extensions

- Explore other classification models for improved performance.
- Tune additional parameters of the chosen model.
- Experiment with alternative feature selection/creation techniques.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of a comprehensive pipeline for predicting the survival status of pediatric patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. By leveraging preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and thoughtful feature selection, the model achieves a notable improvement in accuracy.
